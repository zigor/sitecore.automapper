# Sitecore AutoMapper
AutoMapper extension to get rid of code that maps Sitecore data models to objects

> AutoMapper is a simple little library built to solve a deceptively complex problem - getting rid of code that mapped one object to another. This type of code is rather dreary and boring to write, so why not invent a tool to do it for us?
