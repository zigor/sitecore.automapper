# Sitecore AutoMapper
AutoMapper extension to get rid of code that maps Sitecore items to objects

##What is AutoMapper?
> AutoMapper is an object-object mapper. Object-object mapping works by transforming an input object of one type into an output object of a different type. What makes AutoMapper interesting is that it provides some interesting conventions to take the dirty work out of figuring out how to map type A to type B. As long as type B follows AutoMapper's established convention, almost zero configuration is needed to map two types.
